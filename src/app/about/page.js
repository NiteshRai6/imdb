            <p>IMDb an abbreviation of Internet Movie Database is an online database of information
                related to films, television series, music videos, podcasts, home videos, video games,
                and streaming content online including cast, production crew and personal biographies,
                plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. IMDb began as a fan-operated,
                movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990, and moved to the Web in 1993.
                Since 1998, it is now owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon. </p>

            <p>As of March 2022, the database contained some 10.1 million titles including television episodes
                and 11.5 million person records. Additionally, the site had 83 million registered users.
                The site's message boards were disabled in February 2017.
                As of 12 February, IMDb is the 54th most visited website in the world, according to website
                ranker Alexa.</p>

            <p>The title and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all users, but only registered
                and logged-in users can submit new material and suggest edits to existing entries.
                Most of the site's data has been provided by these volunteers. Registered users with a
                proven track record are able to add and make corrections to cast lists, credits, and
                some other data points. However, the addition and removal of images, and alterations
                to titles, cast and crew names, character names, and plot summaries are subject to an
                approval process; this usually takes between 24 and 72 hours.</p>
